v2.1.0

  Merge in rails-2.2.2 branch, modify to make sure Prawn isn't trampled and
  2.3.0 is supported.
  Simplify tagging of templates for later processing (+ ensure it works
  with compiled templates).
  Update README_RAILS 

v2.0.5

  Fix issue with Echoe being ultra-sensitive on RubyGems versions (v2.0.4
  was RubyGems 1.2 only, and 1.3 just came out)
  
v2.0.4

  Support for TeX escaping (via l()) calling to_s on the argument.
  This should handle nils.

v2.0.3

  Rails 2.0 compat:
  Fix issue with init.rb not requiring rails/init.rb

v1.99.0 2008-04-20

  Released RTeX v1.99.0 as a Rubygem, with a standalone executable for PDF generation
  and support for plugin installation from the executable.

  This release requires Rails >= 2.0.1

  Thanks to:
  * Jonas BÃ¤hr for a patch with additional LaTeX escaping
  * Fouad Mardini for a TemplateHandler patch

v1.0.0+

  Added quite a few *long* overdue fixes & enhancements sent in by various people.

  * Added latex escaping 'l' method (Thanks, Benjamin Quorning)
  * Added support for @options_for_rtex hash for configuration:
    * Added :tempdir option, and changed default temporary directory
      (Thanks, Francesco Levorato)
    * Added :preprocess option to support running through latex before pdflatex
      (Thanks Charles Lesburg, Benjamin Quorning)
    * Moved old @filename setting to :filename option in this hash

  If you're using the same settings for @options_for_rtex often, you might want to 
  put your assignment in a before_filter (perhaps overriding :filename, etc in your actions).
