Like any open source project, RTeX depends on the participation of the community to keep it up to date, relevant, and as usable as possible.

h2. Where?

The "RTeX source":http://github.com/bruce/rtex is hosted on "GitHub":http://github.com.  Please contribute using GitHub if possible.

h2. How to submit changes

Here's the different ways you can send us changes (in descending order of desirability):

* Fork the project in GitHub and send a pull request
* Clone the project somewhere else, and "ask us":/contact to pull your changes from your publically accessible URL
* Send us a git patch
* Send us a manual patch (please note originating commit) if you don't use git
* Send us an email detailing your changes
* Scribble vague changes on a napkin and send COD

h2. Get them accepted

To get your changes accepted as fast as possible, the following really help:

* Including a good reason for the change
* Including good tests (failing before, passing after)
* Making the code as backwards-compatible as possible
* Using _generally accepted_ Ruby code conventions (yes, we know this is subjective)
* Including good documentation

<a id='docs' name='docs'></a>
Note we _do_ accept documentation-only changes (even to this website, stored in @site/@ in the source!).
