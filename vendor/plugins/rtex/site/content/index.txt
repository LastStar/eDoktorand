h2. Welcome

RTeX is a Ruby library (and web framework plugin) used to generate PDF documents on-the-fly using the "LaTeX typesetting system":http://www.latex-project.org/.

Get started with the "Manual":/manual (it's still a bit short, but it's something)!

RTeX is maintained by Bruce Williams (creator, maintaining the v2 branch) and Wiebe Cazemier (maintaining the v1 branch).  See the "Development Roadmap":/roadmap and "Contribution":/contribution pages if you're interested in tracking development, and feel free to "contact":/contact us if you have any questions.
