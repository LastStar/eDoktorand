This Diploma Supplement model was developed by the European Commission, 
Council of Europe and UNESCO/CEPES. The purpose of the supplement is to
provide sufficient independent data to improve the international transparency
and fair academic and professional recognition of qualifications. It is
designed to provide a description of the nature, level, context, content
and status of the studies that were pursued and successfully completed by
the individual named on the original qualification to which this supplement
is appended. This document is free from any value judgements, equivalence
statements or suggestions about recognition. Information in all eight sections
should be provided. Where information is not provided, an explanation should
give the reason why.

\begin{footnotesize}
Higher education institutions form the highest level of Czech education. They
offer accredited study programmes at~three levels --- bachelor, master, and 
doctoral --- as well as lifelong learning. Higher education institutions are
either university-type or nonuniversity-type.


University-type higher education institutions may offer all types of study
programmes (bachelor, master and doctoral) and carry out associated scholarly, 
research, developmental, artistic or other creative activities.

Nonuniversity-type higher education institutions offer mainly bachelor study 
programmes, but may also provide master study programmes and carry out 
associated scholarly, research, developmental, artistic or other creative
activities.


There are public, private state and private higher education institutions. 
The list is available on internet at these addresses: {\bf http://www.msmt.cz} or
{\bf http://www.csvs.cz}

Higher education is realised within the framework of accredited study 
programmes in accordance with their curriculum and given form of studies. 
The form of study can be fulltime, part-time (distance) or a combination 
of~both. Access to a bachelor study programme is conditional on completing 
a full secondary general or vocational education with a leaving 
examination --- {\it maturita} and leaving certificate  --- {\it maturitní
vysvědčení}. Access to master studies is conditional on graduating from a bachelor 
study programme, while access to a doctoral study programme is conditional
on graduating from a master study programme.


The qualification structure recognises bachelor, master and doctoral levels.


A bachelor study programme --- {\it bakalářský studijní program} aims at qualifying
to enter a profession or a master study programme. It takes from 3 to 4 years
(180 -- 240 ECTS credits). Graduates receive the academic degree bachelor ---
{\it bakalář} (Bc.). The study programme must be completed in due form with a final state 
examination, which usually includes the presentation and defence of a bachelor
thesis.


A master study programme --- \textit{magisterský studijní program} follows a bachelor
study programme. The length is 1~--~3 years (60 -- 180 ECTS credits). 
In selected fields, where the nature of the study programme requires,
a master study programme need not follow on from bachelor programme. 
In this case, the programme lasts 4 -- 6 years (240~--~360 ECTS credits). 
Admission to these study programmes is conditional on passing the {\it maturita}
examination (see access to bachelor studies). Graduates in a master study
programme have to take a final state examination and publicly present and
defend a master thesis. The studies in a master programme lead to the 
academic degree:

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\topsep}{-2pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}}
\item {\it magistr} (Mgr.) --- Master in humanities, sciences, law, teacher education,
pharmacy and theology;
\item {\it magistr umění} (MgA.) --- Master of Arts in the field of art;
\item {\it inženýr} (Ing.) --- Engineer in the field of economics, technical sciences and
technologies, agriculture, forestry and in~military fields of study;
\item {\it inženýr architekt} (Ing.arch.) --- Engineer Architect in the field of
architecture;
\item {\it doktor medicíny} (MUDr.) --- Doctor of Medicine in the field of medicine;
\item {\it zubní lékař} (MDDr.) --- Doctor of Dental Medicine in the field of dental
medicine;
\item {\it doktor veterinární mediciny} (MVDr.) --- Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in the
field of veterinary medicine and hygiene
\end{list}

Courses in human medicine and veterinary medicine last 6 years. They are run
by the university medical faculties and faculties of veterinary medicine.

Holders of the academic degree “magistr” can pass a rigorous state examination
in the same field and present and defend a rigorous thesis. If completed 
successfully the following academic degrees are awarded:

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\topsep}{-2pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}}
\item{{\it doktor práv} (JUDr.) in the field of law;}
\item{{\it doktor filozofie} (PhDr.) in the field of humanities, teacher education and
social sciences;}
\item{{\it doktor přírodních věd} (RNDr.) in the field of natural sciences;}
\item{{\it doktor farmacie} (PharmDr.) in the field of pharmacy;}
\item{{\it licenciát teologie} (ThLic.) in the field of Catholic theology;}
\item{{\it licenciát teologie} (ThLic.) or “doktor teologie” (ThDr.) in the field of 
theology except Catholic theology.}
\end{list}

All above mentioned academic titles are at master level and are written in 
front of the name.

The standard length of a doctoral study programme (doktorský studijní program)
is 3 years. Doctoral studies are completed by the state doctoral examination
and the public presentation and defence of a doctoral thesis (dissertation),
based on original results, which must be published. Graduates of a doctoral
study programme are awarded the academic degree of: {\it doktor} (Ph.D.); {\it doktor
teologie} (Th.D.) in the field of theology. These academic titles are written
behind the name.

The academic year starts on September 1 and ends on August 31 of the following
year. It comprises a winter semester and a summer semester. The organization
of academic years is regulated by statute.

A credit system (ECTS or a comparable system) is used at most of the higher
education institutions.
